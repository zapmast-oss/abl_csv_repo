ABL Run Creation Profile
============================
Generated on: 2025-11-15 19:22:40


Breaks down how each lineup manufactures runs: long ball share, stolen-base pressure, and two-out conversion rate.
Great for spotting clubs that live on slugging versus those who pressure defenses or cash in late-inning chances.

Key:
  HR% uses explicit HR RBIs parsed from game logs; SB Att/G = (SB+CS)/G.
  PWR Slugging >=40%, Punchy 30-39%, Balanced 20-29%, Small-ball <20%.
  SPD Relentless >=1.20 att/G, Aggressive 0.80-1.19, Selective 0.40-0.79, Station-to-Station <0.40.
  CLT Two-out Machine >=30%, Timely 20-29%, Occasional 10-19%, Needs Spark <10%.
Definition: HR% is runs via HR / total runs; SB pressure measures attempts per game; 2-out RBI% shows production after two outs.
