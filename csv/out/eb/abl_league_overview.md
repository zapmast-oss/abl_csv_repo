# Action Baseball League (ABL) Overview

Action Baseball League (ABL "able") is a fictional professional baseball organization established in 1972. It consists of 24 teams divided into the National Baseball Conference (NBC) and the American Baseball Conference (ABC). Each conference is further divided into three divisions: Eastern, Central, and Western, with four teams in each division. ABL is committed to ensuring a fair representation of teams from all regions of the nation, including both Northern and Southern cities on both coasts.

ABL's main objective is determining the Grand Champions of Baseball ("The Best of the best"). To achieve this, each conference conducts a 162-game championship season. Each team competes against its conference rivals 12 times, six home games each; 48 games vs. each in-conference division; 96 games total outside the division. Division rivals play each other 22 times each, 11 ball games in each home park for a total of 66 games in the division.

After the regular season, each conference crowns four champions: three Division Champs and one Wild-Card Champ (the non-division champion with the best record).

The Grand Tournament of Champions (GToC) establishes the two conference representatives who compete in the Grand Series. The seeding for the GToC is as follows: Division Champion with the best record is #1, DC with the second-best record is #2, the remaining DC is #3, and Wild Card Champion is #4. The #1 seed will host the #4 seed, and the #2 seed will host the #3 seed.

The tournament consists of three seven-game series: Division Championship Series (DCS), Conference Championship Series (CCS), and Grand Series (GS). The higher seed has a home-field advantage in the DCS and CCS. The team with the best record has the advantage in the GS. Ties are settled by alternating between conferences.

Beginning with the 1981 season, the Wild-Card Champion will no longer play a division rival in the Division Championship Series. If the #1 seed is a team in the same division, the #4 seed will play the #2 seed instead.

Several other notable items about the ABL include no interleague play, league-wide designated hitter, and an annual interconference All-Star game in July with each team represented. Additionally, no team movement or league expansion will occur during the 50 years of planned seasons from 1972-2022.

Each team has an owner, general manager, field manager, coaching staff, ballpark, and scouting system that influences how it is managed and led. The creator of the league does not intervene in any way with any of the teams but enjoys watching the story of this unique league unfold.

Overall, ABL is a fascinating league with a well-thought-out and structured system for determining the Grand Champion of Baseball. Its unique rules and regulations set it apart from other fictional professional baseball leagues and make it an exciting sport to watch!

ABL is dedicated to providing high-quality baseball entertainment to fans across America. With its talented players, passionate fans, and commitment to fair play and sportsmanship, ABL is poised to become one of the premier fictional baseball leagues in the world.
