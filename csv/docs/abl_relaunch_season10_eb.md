This is your on-air opening when you come back from the hiatus:

“The league is on the air.

It’s Monday, May 11, 1981 and for the first time in a long time, we’re back in the Action Baseball League—Season Ten, the grand-daddy of them all. The dust has settled on a year-long hiatus, the lights are back on, and the Detroit Dukes are still sitting on the throne as reigning Grand Champions… at least for now.

Today, we’re going to get you caught up and plugged back in. We’ll walk through what happened in Week Five, who rose, who stumbled, and how the landscape looks as we step into Week Six. We’ll check the power board—the Top Nine in the league. We’ll visit the stat leaders, the teams pounding the ball, the staffs choking off runs, and we’ll take a fresh look at each division race as the tenth season of ABL baseball truly kicks back into gear.

After that, we’ll head down to the field. We’ve got featured matchups on Monday and Tuesday, Showcase Sunday waiting at the end of the road, and a full week of baseball in between. Ten seasons in, and the mission hasn’t changed: twenty-four clubs chasing one title, one more line on the Grand Champions list.

Settle in. The Action Baseball League is back.”

You can adjust “today’s date” and the week numbers as needed; the spine is there.

SIDEBAR: Ten Seasons in the Dugout

You can’t tell the story of ten ABL seasons without talking about the men in the dugout.

Managers don’t get WAR. They don’t get spray charts. They get scars. They get second-guessed on the call-in shows and immortalized in the quiet lines of a media guide: games managed, wins, losses, flags.

A decade in, the league has already sorted some of them into types. There are the lifers—the men who have ridden with one franchise from the lean years through the first parade, their fingerprints baked into the culture. There are the hired guns, the résumé guys who show up with a reputation and a suitcase, expected to “fix” a club in three seasons or less. And there are the failed experiments, the analytics darlings and clubhouse whisperers who flashed an idea but never quite turned it into October wins.

Look closely at this tenth campaign and you’ll see it: clubs whose managers are on their third life, squeezing one more run out of a core; others already on their second man in five years, still hunting for a voice the room will follow. Some dugouts are run by champions who can point to a ring and say, “Do it my way.” Others are run by survivors whose greatest achievement so far is simply still having the job.

When you watch an ABL game this season, don’t just look at the lineup card. Look at the man holding it. Ten seasons in, the league has plenty of stars on the field—but the quiet arms race in the dugout may decide who gets to call themselves Grand Champion next.
