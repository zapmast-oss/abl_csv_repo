SimBaseballVision - Output Audit Refactor

This repository is part of the SimBaseballVision (SBV) network, focusing on refining and auditing the output structure of our baseball simulation data. This branch is specifically for reorganizing and refactoring the CSV and text report outputs to ensure all files are structured and referenced consistently.

Setup & Usage

Clone the repository and check out the refactor-output-audit branch.

All refactored outputs are found under the csv/out directory, reorganized for clarity.

Follow any additional notes in the README to run scripts or analyze data outputs.

Contributing

Feel free to contribute by submitting pull requests, especially if you have improvements on the refactoring process or new audit checks.
